 Minicosmos Levels, created by Aymeric du Peloux. Aymeric has created another level set in the tradition of Microcosmos. He says this set is for beginners because the levels have only 2 or 3 stones. But I still found them interesting, even though I'm an experienced player. Many of the levels come in pairs: a relatively easy level with 2 stones, followed by a more challenging level with the same layout and an extra stone. This is a nice way of providing hints.
